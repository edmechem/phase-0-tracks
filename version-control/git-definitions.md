# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is *version control*?  Why is it useful?
  * A system for managing the revisions of files.
  * It's useful as it tracks the changes so the document can be rolled back to a stable version. 

* What is a *branch* and why would you use one?
  * A branch allows for experimental development coding to be worked on in isolation, ensuring that the most stable master version is not corrupted. 

* What is a *commit*? What makes a good commit message?
  * Captures the changes to a file, giving a timestamp, the user who made the change and an ID to allow the document to be reverted back to that particular version or to allow it to be compared to other versions.
  * It should convey the changes that occurred clearly so that others can understand immediately what was done. 

* What is a *merge conflict*?
  * When files are merged back into the master branch and there are conflicting data that needs to be resolved, first, before the merge is finalized.
