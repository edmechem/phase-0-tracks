Elevator algorithm:

1. Enter elevator.
2. Turn 180%.
3. Search until you recognize a panel with multiple buttons:
    a. On wall to left of door
    b. On wall to right of door
4. Initialize an empty "button_array" (each 'button' will have x, y coordinates & button number)
5. On panel of buttons, scan from top left to bottom right, until you see no more buttons. For each button:
    a. Store x,y coordinates, as well as number, as new item in "button_array".
8. "floor_valid" = false
7. Until "floor_valid":
        a. Get "desired_floor" from user (number)
        b. If "desired_floor" is valid (i.e. is contained in button number element of some item of "button_array"):
            i. Press button number "desired_floor" by pressing panel at its x,y coordinates
            ii. "floor_valid" = true
        else
            Tell user you're sorry, but that's a floor this elevator can't go to.
        end if
    end

1. Locate in kitchen: Orange, knife, cutting board, juicer, glass, counter with 2 sq. feet of clear space, sink, dishrack, compost bin
2. Place cutting board on counter, juicer & glass on counter
3. Place orange & knife on cutting board
4. Using knife, cut orange in half
5. Rinse knife in sink, put in dishrack
6. For each orange half:
    a. Pick up orange half
    b. "no_more_juice" = false
    c. Until "no_more_juice"
        i. Observe juicer while pressing orange down on juicer & rotating orange 90%
        ii. If juice did not flow down from juicer
            "no_more_juice" = true
        end
    end
7. Place both orange halves in compost bin
8. Pour juice from juicer to glass
9. Rinse cutting board & juicer in sink, put in dishrack
10. Enjoy glass of fresh squeezed orange juice
