### 9.3 jQuery - Ed Mechem

#### Release 0: Make a Plan

**Make a few notes in the file on how I plan to approach the topic, and why.**

Moving this question to the top - it's kind of a meta-question, my answers to all the other questions consists of the answer to this one.

**How I intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as I can in two hours.**

I will build an HTML page with corresponding script.js file, and basically use that as a playpen, to try out all the jquery ideas I find interesting.


**What sorts of resources will help?**

No idea. I mean, I'll find out. I'm guessing just documentation & cheat sheets that have example code. Maybe someone's blog or article about how they did a particular thing, how they used jQuery to solve a specific problem.


**How often should I stop and test what I just learned?**

Fairly often. I mean, my preferred style of learning is to implement everything I learn, as I learn it. Get the muscle memory of typing it, notice any quirks or particularities the instructions may not have anticipated. Once I can do a thing, it's real. Until then, it's theoritical. The only exception would be when there's a group of things that all are conceptually very similar, same syntax, etc. Maybe in that case I'd try one or two, note what the others are, and consider them all 'one thing' that I've just learned.


**Are breaks important?**

Oh hells yes. There's like no way I've been able to lear all of phase zero without regular breaks. Sometimes I take a break right after I successfully do something, it's great to just let it absorb. Othertimes I'll take a break when I'm super confused. Talk myself out of / thru it. Simply talk out loud to myself about it, just expressing it helps.
