	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph of text. Nice how Sublime Text auto-fills <strong>both</strong> the opening &amp; closing tags. Oh, and helpfully reminds me to fix the single ampersand.</p>
	<p>Let's talk about cats for a moment. I have a "Mackerel tabby" (tiger stripes) named "Kitty G" or "Kittiji" (depending on what meaning you wish to ascribe to him). He's 7 yrs. old, and is still playful. A few ways he likes to play:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Chases his tail. <em>For reals!</em> Just started doing this recently.</li>
		<li>Runs around like a madman. Usually late in the evening.</li>
		<li>Chases after a little toy: a little bunch of bubblewrap, held by wire to a stick.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>What are the most adorable things about him?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Super cute.</li>
		<li>Will let you hold him any which way; upside down, like a noodle, etc.</li>
		<li>Lets you clip his nails! Well, so that's not cute per se, but it's nice nonetheless.</li>
	</ol>
