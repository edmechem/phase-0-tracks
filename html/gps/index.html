			<p>Here's another aside: these are my "Release 4: Reflect" comments.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</b><br>
				The HTML5 semantic tags exist to provide an indication of the meaning, type &amp; purpose of various sections of the page. They all seem useful, but if I had an RSS Feed Reader subscription to some site or blog, the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag would be particularly useful, in that it would tell the feed reader what part of the page it should pay attention to, and what part (ouside the article element) can be ignored.</li>
				<li><b>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</b><br>
				We haven't learned CSS yet, so without and style indicating a different placement, the browser basically displays elements in order, top to bottom.</li>
				<li><b>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</b><br>
				Sublime's snippets are awesome. My guide helped me walk thru the process of learning the syntax of Sublime snippets. I definitely think it's a useful feature that I'll find various other uses for as we progress.</li>
				<li><b>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?</b><br>
				Understanding the proper nesting of the HTML5 semantic tags was the difficult concept for me to understand. The <a href="http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png" target="_blank">HTML5 Element Flowchart</a> on HTML5 Doctor was pretty great; although it neglected to include a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag for the entire page (which should come before nav), and a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element after nav, encompassing the article element(s).
